## 👥 USER MANAGEMENT

### Creating Additional Users

**As Admin**, you can create users for your team:

```bash
# Via API (requires admin session)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/auth/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --cookie-jar cookies.txt \
  -d '{
    "email": "john@company.com",
    "password": "SecurePassword123!",
    "full_name": "John Doe",
    "role": "company_user"
  }'
```

### Assigning Users to Companies

```bash
# Assign user to a specific company with custom permissions
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/auth/users/2/companies/1 \
  -H "Content-Type": application/json" \
  --cookie-jar cookies.txt \
  -d '{
    "can_view_sync": true,
    "can_run_sync": true,
    "can_edit_credentials": false,
    "can_manage_schedules": false

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Can't Login?
- Check database connection (MySQL running?)
- Verify user exists: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='admin@devpos-sync.local'`
- Clear browser cookies and try again
- Check browser console for errors

### "Permission Denied"?
- User may not be assigned to that company
- Check: `SELECT * FROM user_company_access WHERE user_id=?`
- Re-run: `php bin/setup-auth.php` to reset admin access

### DevPos Connection Fails?
- Verify tenant ID is correct
- Check credentials are saved in database
- Ensure `.env` has `DEVPOS_AUTH_BASIC=Zmlza2FsaXppbWlfc3BhOg==`
- Test with: `php bin/test-devpos-working.php`

### QuickBooks OAuth Not Working?
- Check `QBO_CLIENT_ID` and `QBO_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`
- Verify redirect URI matches Intuit app settings
- Ensure popup not blocked by browser
- Check OAuth callback endpoint exists
