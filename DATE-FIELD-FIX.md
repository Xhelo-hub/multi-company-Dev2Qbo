# ‚úÖ DATE FIELD FIX - CRITICAL UPDATE

## Problem Summary

**Issue:** Invoices, bills, and sales receipts were being created in QuickBooks with **today's date** instead of the **actual transaction date from DevPos**.

**Root Cause:** The transformers were checking for `dateTimeCreated` as the primary date field, but DevPos actually returns `invoiceCreatedDate` in their API responses.

---

## What Was Fixed

### Files Modified

1. **src/Transformers/InvoiceTransformer.php**
2. **src/Transformers/BillTransformer.php**  
3. **src/Transformers/SalesReceiptTransformer.php**

### Changes Made

**BEFORE (Wrong):**
```php
$issueDate = $devposInvoice['dateTimeCreated']      // PRIMARY - but this field doesn't exist!
    ?? $devposInvoice['createdDate']
    ?? $devposInvoice['issueDate']
    // ... other fallbacks
```

**AFTER (Fixed):**
```php
$issueDate = $devposInvoice['invoiceCreatedDate']   // PRIMARY - actual API field returned
    ?? $devposInvoice['dateTimeCreated']            // Alternative
    ?? $devposInvoice['createdDate']
    ?? $devposInvoice['issueDate']
    // ... other fallbacks
```

## DevPos API Field Reference

### What DevPos Actually Returns

Based on actual API responses documented in `CURRENT-FIELD-MAPPING.md`:

```json
{
  "eic": "a963d2d8-8945-45af-a2c9-6db284c72a71",
  "documentNumber": "2/2025",
  "invoiceCreatedDate": "2025-05-21T14:33:57+02:00",  ‚Üê THIS IS THE DATE FIELD
  "dueDate": "2025-05-22T00:00:00+02:00",
  "invoiceStatus": "Pranuar",
  "amount": 0.0,
  "buyerNuis": "L88929571P",
  "buyerName": "KISHA UNGJILLORE MEMALIAJ",
  "sellerNuis": "K43128625A"
}
```

### Complete Date Field Priority

All three transformers now check fields in this order:

1. **`invoiceCreatedDate`** ‚Üê **PRIMARY** (actual field DevPos returns)
2. `dateTimeCreated` ‚Üê Alternative (might exist in other endpoints)
3. `createdDate` ‚Üê Fallback
4. `issueDate` ‚Üê Fallback
5. `dateCreated` ‚Üê Fallback
6. `created_at` ‚Üê Fallback
7. `dateIssued` ‚Üê Fallback
8. `date` ‚Üê Fallback
9. `invoiceDate` ‚Üê Fallback (invoices only)
10. `documentDate` ‚Üê Fallback (invoices/receipts only)

If **none** of these fields exist, it falls back to `date('Y-m-d')` (today's date) and logs a warning.

## QuickBooks Field Mapping

### Sales Invoices
```php
'TxnDate' => substr($issueDate, 0, 10)  // Format: YYYY-MM-DD
```

### Purchase Bills
```php
'TxnDate' => substr($issueDate, 0, 10)  // Bill date
'DueDate' => substr($issueDate, 0, 10)  // Same as bill date for now
```

### Sales Receipts (Cash Sales)
```php
'TxnDate' => substr($issueDate, 0, 10)  // Transaction date
```

---

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Run a Sync Job

From the dashboard or via API:
```bash
curl -X POST https://devsync.konsulence.al/api/sync/1/sales \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### 2. Check the Logs

Look for these log entries to confirm the date is being extracted:

```bash
ssh root@78.46.201.151 "tail -100 /var/log/apache2/error.log | grep 'Using date field\|TxnDate being set'"
```

**Expected output:**
```
INFO: Using date field with value: 2025-05-21T14:33:57+02:00
INFO: QuickBooks Invoice TxnDate being set to: 2025-05-21
```

**If you see this instead, there's still a problem:**
```
WARNING: No date found in DevPos invoice
```

### 3. Verify in QuickBooks

1. Log into QuickBooks Online
2. Go to Sales ‚Üí Invoices (or Expenses ‚Üí Bills)
3. Check the transaction date on synced records
4. **It should match the DevPos invoice date, NOT today's date**

## Additional Field Mapping Insights

### What Works ‚úÖ

| DevPos Field | QuickBooks Field | Status |
|-------------|------------------|--------|
| `eic` | CustomField[EIC] | ‚úÖ Working |
| `documentNumber` | `DocNumber` | ‚úÖ Working |
| `invoiceCreatedDate` | `TxnDate` | ‚úÖ **FIXED** |
| `totalAmount` / `amount` | `Line[0].Amount` | ‚úÖ Working (with caveats) |

### What's Still Hardcoded ‚ö†Ô∏è

| DevPos Field | QuickBooks Field | Current Status | Impact |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|--------|
| `buyerName` | `CustomerRef.value` | ‚ö†Ô∏è Hardcoded to "1" | All invoices go to default customer |
| `buyerNuis` | - | ‚ö†Ô∏è Not used | Can't match by tax ID |
| `sellerName` | `VendorRef.value` | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially working | Bills may use wrong vendor |
| Line items | `ItemRef.value` | ‚ö†Ô∏è Hardcoded to "1" | All items show as "Services" |

### What's Not Fetched Yet ‚ùå

| DevPos Feature | QuickBooks Capability | Status |
|---------------|----------------------|--------|
| Line item details | Multiple `Line[]` entries | ‚ùå Not implemented |
| Product descriptions | `Description` per line | ‚ùå Not implemented |
| PDF attachments | `Attachments` | ‚ùå Partially implemented |
| Customer matching | Customer lookup/create | ‚ùå Not implemented |

## Recommended Next Steps

### Priority 1: Verify Date Fix (NOW)
1. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Date field mapping fixed
2. üîÑ **PENDING** - Run sync job to test
3. üîÑ **PENDING** - Verify dates in QuickBooks

### Priority 2: Customer/Vendor Mapping (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** All invoices assigned to default customer ID "1"

**Impact:** Can't track which customer owes what

**Solution:**
- Implement `getOrCreateCustomer()` function
- Look up QuickBooks customer by name or tax ID
- Create customer if doesn't exist
- Store mapping in database

### Priority 3: Line Item Support (HIGH)
**Problem:** All invoices have single "Services" line

**Impact:** No product detail, all revenue goes to one item

**Solution:**
- Call `getEInvoiceByEIC()` to get full invoice details
- Parse line items array
- Map products to QuickBooks items
- Create multiple `Line[]` entries

### Priority 4: PDF Attachments (MEDIUM)
**Problem:** PDFs not showing in QuickBooks

**Investigation needed:**
- Check if `pdf` field exists in API response
- Verify Base64 decoding
- Add error logging to attachment upload
- Test with manual upload

---

## Known Limitations

### Amount Field Issues
Some invoices in DevPos list API return `amount: 0.0`. This is a DevPos API limitation where the list endpoint doesn't include complete financial data.

**Workaround:** Fetch full invoice via `getEInvoiceByEIC(eic)` which includes complete line items and totals.

### Simplified Invoices (Cash Sales)
DevPos marks cash transactions with `isSimplifiedInvoice: true`. These should be synced as SalesReceipts, not Invoices.

**Current handling:** Partially implemented in SalesSync.php

---

## Diagnostic Tool

A new diagnostic tool has been created: **`bin/show-devpos-fields.php`**

### Usage
```bash
php bin/show-devpos-fields.php <company_id>
```

### What It Shows
1. All available DevPos fields for invoices and bills
2. Field types and sample values
3. Which fields are checked and in what order
4. Which field is actually used for the date
5. Current QuickBooks mapping
6. Warnings for missing or hardcoded fields

### Example Output
```
üìÖ DATE FIELDS:
   Checking in order: invoiceCreatedDate, dateTimeCreated, createdDate, issueDate, dateCreated
   ‚úÖ invoiceCreatedDate: 2025-05-21T14:33:57+02:00
   ‚ùå dateTimeCreated: NOT FOUND
   ‚ùå createdDate: NOT FOUND
   ‚Üí Maps to QuickBooks: TxnDate
   ‚Üí USING: invoiceCreatedDate = 2025-05-21T14:33:57+02:00
```

‚úÖ **DEPLOYED:** Changes live on production server  
üîÑ **TESTING:** Need to run sync job to verify  
‚ö†Ô∏è **REMAINING:** Customer mapping, line items, PDF attachments still need work  

**Expected Outcome:** Transaction dates in QuickBooks should now match the actual DevPos invoice/bill dates instead of showing today's date.
