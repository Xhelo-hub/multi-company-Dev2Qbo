### 1. Database Schema
✅ **audit_logs table** - Tracks all user actions and system events
- Fields: user_id, action, entity_type, entity_id, details (JSON), ip_address, user_agent, created_at
- Indexes on user, action, entity, and timestamp for fast queries

### 2. API Endpoints Added

#### Company Management (routes/api.php)
- `POST /api/companies` - Create new company (admin only)
- `PATCH /api/companies/{id}` - Update company details/status (admin only)

#### User Management (routes/auth.php)
- `GET /api/auth/users/{userId}/companies` - Get user's company assignments (admin only)
- `PATCH /api/auth/users/{userId}` - Update user status (toggle active/inactive) (admin only)

#### Audit Logging (routes/api.php)

  - Supports filters: action, user_id, company_id, date_from, date_to, limit, offset
- `GET /api/admin/recent-activity` - Get combined sync jobs and audit logs (admin only)

### 3. Audit Logging Integration
