Schedule 2: Daily full sync at night (2:00 AM)
Schedule 3: Monthly reconciliation (1st of month)
```

## üîÑ How Schedules Execute

### Background Scheduler Required

Schedules are stored in the database and executed by a background process:

**For Development/Testing:**
```powershell
# Run the scheduler (checks every minute for due schedules)
php bin/schedule-runner.php
```

**For Production:**

#### Windows (Task Scheduler)
1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create Basic Task
3. Trigger: On a schedule ‚Üí Daily
4. Action: Start a program ‚Üí `php.exe`
5. Arguments: `C:\path\to\multi-company-Dev2Qbo\bin\schedule-runner.php`
6. Repeat every: 1 minute

#### Linux (Crontab)
```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line (runs every minute)
* * * * * cd /path/to/multi-company-Dev2Qbo && php bin/schedule-runner.php --once >> logs/scheduler.log 2>&1
```

### What Happens When Schedule Runs

1. Background scheduler checks for due schedules
2. Creates a sync job in `sync_jobs` table
3. Executes the sync (DevPos ‚Üí QuickBooks)
4. Updates schedule's `last_run_at` timestamp
5. Calculates and sets `next_run_at` timestamp
6. Results stored in sync job history

## üéØ Pre-Configured Frequencies

### Daily at 1:00 PM
```json
{
  "frequency": "daily",
  "time_of_day": "13:00:00"
}
```
**Use case:** End-of-business-day sync

### Weekly Friday 5:00 PM
```json
{
  "frequency": "weekly",
  "day_of_week": 5,
  "time_of_day": "17:00:00"
}
```
**Use case:** Weekly reconciliation before weekend

### Monthly 1st at 1:00 AM
```json
{
  "frequency": "monthly",
  "day_of_month": 1,
  "time_of_day": "01:00:00"
}
```
**Use case:** Monthly closing and reporting

## üìä Schedule Database Structure

Schedules are stored in `sync_schedules` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sync_schedules (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id INT NOT NULL,
    schedule_name VARCHAR(100),
    job_type ENUM('sales', 'purchases', 'bills', 'full'),
    frequency ENUM('hourly', 'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly', 'custom'),
    time_of_day TIME,           -- e.g., '13:00:00'
    day_of_week INT,            -- 1-7 (Monday-Sunday)
    day_of_month INT,           -- 1-31
    cron_expression VARCHAR(100), -- For custom schedules
    is_active TINYINT(1),
    last_run_at TIMESTAMP,
    next_run_at TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## üîê Permissions

- **Admin Users**: Can create/manage schedules for all companies
- **Company Users**: Can create/manage schedules for assigned companies

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Scheduler Must Be Running**: Schedules won't execute automatically unless the background scheduler process is running.

2. **Server Time**: All times are in server time zone. Make sure your server clock is correct.

3. **Missed Schedules**: If scheduler was offline and missed a schedule, it will execute it on next check.

4. **Multiple Schedules**: You can have multiple schedules for the same company (e.g., hourly + daily).

5. **Credentials Required**: Company must have DevPos and QuickBooks credentials configured for schedules to work.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Schedule not running?
1. Check if scheduler process is running: `ps aux | grep schedule-runner`
2. Check scheduler logs: `tail -f logs/scheduler.log`
3. Verify schedule is active (not paused)
4. Check `next_run_at` timestamp in database

### Schedule runs but sync fails?
1. Check sync job history in dashboard
2. Verify DevPos credentials are correct
3. Verify QuickBooks connection is active
4. Check error logs in `sync_jobs` table

### Want to test a schedule immediately?
Use the manual sync button in the dashboard, or update `next_run_at` to current time:
```sql
UPDATE sync_schedules 
SET next_run_at = NOW() 
WHERE id = YOUR_SCHEDULE_ID;
```

## üìñ API Endpoints

```
