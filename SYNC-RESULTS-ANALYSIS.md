## What You'll See in QuickBooks

If you log into QuickBooks (sandbox), you'll see:

**Sales → Invoices:**
- 9 new invoices all assigned to **Customer #1** (probably "Amy's Bird Sanctuary")
- Invoice numbers: 1/2025, 2/2025, 3/2025, 4/2025, 5/2025, 6/2025, 7/2025, 8/2025
- One invoice (2/2025 first occurrence) shows $0.00
- Other 8 invoices have correct amounts
- All items show as "Services" (generic)
- Custom field "EIC" contains truncated invoice ID

**What Should Be There:**
- Invoices assigned to actual customers by name
- Correct amounts for all invoices
- Proper line item descriptions
- Customer tax IDs linked

---

## The Core Problems

### 1. Customer Mapping Missing
**Current Code (Line 686 & 703 in SyncExecutor.php):**
```php
'CustomerRef' => [
    'value' => '1' // ← HARDCODED!
]
```

**What It Should Be:**
```php
// Look up customer by NUIS (tax ID) or name
$customerId = $this->findOrCreateQBOCustomer($buyerName, $buyerNuis, $companyId);

'CustomerRef' => [
    'value' => $customerId  // ← Actual customer ID
]
```

### 2. Zero Amount Mystery
DevPos API returns `amount: 0.0` for some invoices even though they should have values.

**Possible causes:**
- DevPos list endpoint doesn't include full details
- Need to call detail endpoint: `/EInvoice/GetByEIC/{eic}`
- Different field has the actual total (totalAmount? totalWithVat?)
- Invoice is actually cancelled/void in DevPos

### 3. No Line Item Details
Single line with description "Invoice: X/2025" instead of actual products/services sold.

**Need to:**
- Fetch invoice details from DevPos
- Parse line items
- Map each product to QBO item
- Send multiple lines instead of one summary line

---

## Next Steps to Fix

### Immediate (Critical):
1. **Add customer mapping** - Without this, all invoices are useless
2. **Investigate zero amounts** - Call DevPos detail endpoint
3. **Switch to production** - If you want real QuickBooks data

### Short-term (Important):
4. **Add line items** - Fetch invoice details, parse products
5. **Product mapping** - Map DevPos products to QBO items
6. **Test thoroughly** - Verify data in QuickBooks matches DevPos

Would you like me to implement the customer mapping system first?
